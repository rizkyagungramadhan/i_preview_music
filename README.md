<details><summary>Deploy Application</summary>

    
     In this step I'm using Android Studio
  
  1. Open application project and find android folder (under project root folder)
  2. ```Right click``` -> ```Flutter``` -> ```Open Android Module in Android Studio```
  3. Go to ```Build``` -> ```Generate Signed Bundle or APK``` (choose Android App Bundle) if you want to deploy to Google Play Store since aab file size is smaller than APK.
  4. In Key store path, click ```Choose existing``` and click ```Project Directory``` (green android logo) -> ```app``` -> ```cert``` there you have a file called ```key.jks```, select this.
  5. Fill key alias and those password, you can find this information in ```build.gradle``` file **(app level)**.
  6. Finally choose the build variant you want to deploy.
   7. Wait for build to finish and there is popup in bottom corner of the IDE said they have an aab or APK files for you.
